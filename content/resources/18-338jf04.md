description: The power of infinite random matrix theory comes from being able to systematically
  identify and work with non-crossing partitions (as depicted on the left). The figure
  on the right depicts a crossing partition which becomes important when trying to
  understand the higher order terms which infinite random matrix theory cannot predict.
